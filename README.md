# Detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies, and the preprint is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562967v2.

v1.0 is the code implemented for the time series data of allele frequencies, where missing values are not allowed.

v1.1 is the code implemented for the time series data of allele frequencies, where missing values are allowed.
