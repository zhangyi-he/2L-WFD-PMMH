# Detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies with forward-in-time simulations
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies through forward-in-time simulations, and the preprint is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562967v3.

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case that missing values are not allowed.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case that missing values are allowed.
